# OpenSpotify

OpenSpotify is a fast and efficient reverse-engineered Spotify API, allowing unlimited access to Spotify's private API without the need for API keys. It provides access to all Spotify API routes, including private routes and data.

## Features

- Access Private and Commercial Spotify API routes without API keys.
- Retrieve private Spotify data.
- Encrypted data handling for security.

## Installation

To install OpenSpotify, use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/anonyxbiz/OpenSpotify
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure you set the `safe_key` environment variable for encryption and decryption:

```bash
export safe_key=your_safe_key_here
```

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize and use the `OpenSpotify` API, create an instance of the `Spotify` class:

```python
from openspotify import Spotify

spotify = Spotify()

```

### Retrieve Album Data

You can retrieve album data using the `get_album_data` method:

```python
album_data = await spotify.get_album_data('spotify_album_uri')
print(album_data)
```

### Logging

The logging functionality is provided by the `Logging` class. You can log data using the `log_data` method:

```python
await logger.log_data('Your log message here')
```

### Encryption and Decryption

To encrypt or decrypt data, use the `Safe` class:

```python
from openspotify import safe

encrypted_data = safe.tool('your_data_here', 'encrypt')
decrypted_data = safe.tool(encrypted_data, 'decrypt')
```

## Classes and Methods

### Route Class

- `get(url, headers={}, params={}, timeout=60)`: Sends a GET request.
- `post(url, headers={}, data={}, json={}, timeout=60)`: Sends a POST request.

### Logging Class

- `log_data(data, do=None)`: Logs data to the console or exits the program if `do='q'`.
